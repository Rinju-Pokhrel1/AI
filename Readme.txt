## Overview  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Develop core AI programming skills.  
- Practice and apply fundamental algorithms and models.  
- Maintain a structured record of learning progress.  

This repository emphasizes **hands-on learning** and serves as a reference for revisiting key AI concepts in the future.

## Learning Objectives  

- Understand search and pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, A*, and Best First Search.  
- Explore different types of intelligent agents: Reflex-based, Goal-based, Utility-based, and Model-based.  
- Implement neural network models such as Hebbian Learning, Perceptron, and Backpropagation.  
- Apply evolutionary computation using Genetic Algorithms.  
- Use probabilistic models like Naive Bayes for classification tasks.  
- Build small programs to support AI learning and experimentation.
